# feed-gipeda [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sgraf812/feed-gipeda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sgraf812/feed-gipeda)

A daemon to continuously run [gipeda](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gipeda) on a list of pre-configured repositories after having run a benchmark script on each (repo, commit) pair it cannot find a benchmark results file for.

Use this when you host a variety of repositories and want to display performance data about them. Although the defaults are clearly biased in towards of Haskell repositories using `cabal`/`stack`, the script to run on each new commit can be configured.

## I think I could use this but I haven't understood a word

`feed-gipeda` extracts repositories to watch from a \*.yaml file (c.f. Config file), which is continuously watched for changes. For each remote repository, a unique but human-readable directory (`<base-name>-<hash-of-URI>`) is created, under which a bare clone resides in the `repository/` folder.

All repositories are re-fetched at a configurable interval (`--dt`) and every commit for which there is no \*.csv result file in `site/out/results` generated yet causes the `--benchmark` command to be run. The concrete picture above uses [`cloben`](https://github.com/sgraf812/cloben) for that, but any other executable expecting a remote URI and commit SHA as the only two arguments and writing its (currently `cloben`-conformant) CSV output to `stdout` should do.

After a number of `--benchmark` runs a `--gipeda` run follows to update the generated `site/` with the added results.

## How to get it to run

After having a working `gipeda` installation, the following steps should get you started (using `cabal` in a similar way):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sgraf812/cloben
$ cd cloben; stack install; cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/sgraf812/feed-gipeda
$ cd feed-gipeda; stack install; cd ..
```

Using `cloben` is of course optional, but the easiest way to get you started (if you want to benchmark `cabal`-conformant Haskell repositories).

By now, `$ feed-gipeda --help` should spit out maybe more up-to-date documentation than this README and you can read about supplying custom paths to various files such as the configuration file. For the sake of the example, we will use the default location, which is at `~/.feed-gipeda/feed-gipeda.yaml`. Put this into that file:
```
repositories:
- https://github.com/sgraf812/benchmark-test
```
That file will be watched for changes, so you can make it part of a git repository (like I did [here](https://github.com/sgraf812/.feed-gipeda)) and fetch updates as part of a `cron` job.

Now find yourself a quiet little tmp folder and run
```
$ feed-gipeda --help
...
$ feed-gipeda --gipeda <path/to/gipeda/executable>
```
You could also add your gipeda installation to `$PATH` and `feed-gipeda` would work with the defaults (I think, untested).

## Config file

Contains the list of repositories to watch encoded in a YAML file. Is supplied via the `--config` option, which defaults to `~/.feed-gipeda/feed-gipeda.yaml` (resp. `%APPDATA%/Roaming/.feed-gipeda/feed-gipeda.yaml` on Windows).

For an example, see <https://github.com/sgraf812/.feed-gipeda> or the example 2 line file above.
The file must contain a top-level `repositories` mapping to a list of repository URIs.

## Define 'Gipeda installation'

The website generated by `gipeda` relies on certain files to be present, which aren't automatically inserted. Thus `feed-gipeda` will do that, but requires that the files are in the same folder as the passed `gipeda` executable. My gipeda installation looks like this:
```
$ tree
.
├── gipeda
├── install-jslibs.sh
└── site
    ├── index.html
    └── js
        └── gipeda.js
```
You can find the respective files in the `gipeda` repository.
